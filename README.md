# **DungeonMania**

## About the Project
Within the course COMP2511 22T2, I was apart of a group project that developed the backend for a game called
'Dungeon Mania'. This is a Pac-Man like simulation where a Player has to avoid enemies and collect gold along with 
other goals/missions in order to win. The entire project was constructed in Java.

**NOTE:** This contains only backend *.java files, excluding frontend implementations and controller abstractions. Only showing my Java coding capabilities.
